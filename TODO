TODO
----

- Allow creation of a test suite to handle multiple failures/errors so all tests
  can be run in one go and all test results can be seen.
- Add a TEST(testname) macro so it's obvious which functions are tests?
- before()/after() hooks?
- Add support for multiple test suites to be run at the same time.
